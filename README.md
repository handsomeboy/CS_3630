- Describe and explain what robots are and what they can do
- Describe mathematically the position and orientation of objects and how they move
- Develop a control architecture for a mobile robotic system
- Implement navigation and localization algorithms based on sensor fusion and environment representation
- Write moderately involved programs in Python to control a robotic system
- Construct, program, and test the operation of a robotic system to perform a specified task
