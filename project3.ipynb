Since the code of Markov Localization is already given to you in the textbook, we will focus on understanding the code and parameters that are used in Manuel's algorithm. For this section, you will tune Manuel's parameters and record the results in the online report on Gradescope.\n"

In fact, Manuel could be at any position with non-zero probability, so you will need to help Manuel perform a motion update at each possible location under the Markov continuous state model. **_This could be a problem if the number of states is huge._** And in the current assignment, there are 5000 (50 \\* 100) cells in the grid map so there are 5000 states in total.\n"
